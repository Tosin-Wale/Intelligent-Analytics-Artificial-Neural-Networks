# Intelligent-Analytics-Artificial-Neural-Networks
This repository contains my work and learnings from my favorite class on Intelligent Analytics. It contains works on Percetrons, Support Vector Machines, Deep Learning methods, Dimensionality Reduction, Decision Trees, Ensemble methods and so much more. It is for my continous learning on the subject

## Multi-layer Perceptrons

## Single layer Perceptron

## Decision trees and ensemble methods (Supervised learning)

## Support Vector Machines

## Dimensionality Reduction (Unsupervised learning)

## Deep Learning
